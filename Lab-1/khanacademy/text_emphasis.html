        <h2>Basic info:</h2>
        <p>Rabbits are <em>small, fluffy mammals</em> in the family Leporidae, 
            known for their long ears, strong hind legs for hopping,
             and short tails. As herbivores, they eat plants 
             and live in groups within underground tunnels called warrens.
             <strong>They are popular pets and common,
             widely found in various habitats, including <em>forests,
             grasslands, and deserts. </em> </strong></p>
