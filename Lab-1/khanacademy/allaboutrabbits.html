        <h2>Basic info:</h2>
        <p>Rabbits are small, fluffy mammals in the family Leporidae, 
            known for their long ears, strong hind legs for hopping,
             and short tails. As herbivores, they eat plants 
             and live in groups within underground tunnels called warrens.
            They are popular pets and common,
             widely found in various habitats, including forests,
              grasslands, and deserts. </p>
